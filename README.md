Hi, I'm @PiyangshuBanik.
🚀 As a first-year Computer Science Engineering student at Chandigarh University, specializing in the Internet of Things (IoT), I am passionate about harnessing technology to create meaningful solutions. 🌐

👨‍💻 I have honed my skills in Python, showcasing my projects on GitHub to demonstrate my practical application of the language. Currently delving into C, C++, Java, and JavaScript, my aim is to continuously enhance my expertise and stand out in the dynamic field of technology.

🔍 In the realm of research, I am actively contributing to projects with real-world impact. One such endeavor involves using AI and machine learning to detect Parkinson's disease—an initiative that aligns with my commitment to leveraging technology for healthcare.

🤖 On the IoT front, I am part of a dynamic team working on innovative projects, including a radar for human and object detection and a groundbreaking 'Hand Gestured Controlled Car.' These projects not only fuel my passion for technology but also underscore my dedication to pushing boundaries.

🏆 My achievements include a national-level rank in NSEA and recognition in the BITS Pilani Code Fest, reflecting my commitment to excellence in both academics and real-world problem-solving.

Join me on this exciting journey at the intersection of technology and innovation! Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of the digital landscape, and for more information, you can reach out to me @cielo_astrophel on instagram. 🌐🚀
